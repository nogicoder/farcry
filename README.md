ar Cry is a first-person shooter (FPS) video game with amazing graphics, developed by Crytek and published by Ubisoft. The game was released in 2004 for Microsoft Windows. The game was a huge commercial success. Ubisoft closed the online servers almost 12 years later. Far Cry features several multiplayer modes in which players basically score points by killing other players. One of these multiplayer modes is deathmatch, also known as free for all (FFA), which goals is to kill (or frag, from the military term) as many other players as possible within a limited period of time. Basically, everything that moves SHOULD be killedâ€¦ :)
